## Setting up your local environment

You can run the MkDocs content included in this repo locally as a test of your changes.
To do this, it may be easiest to make the local repository importable as a module in Python.
There are several ways to accomplish this, one of which is to create a virtual environment,
and add the path to your local repository (e.g. `C:\Users\sgaud\git\mkdocs-madlibs`) to a `.pth` file in your virtual environment's `site-packages` directory.
